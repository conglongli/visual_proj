\section{Evaluation Plan and Goals}

Our first goal is to create a system that returns qualitatively good content-based image retrieval based on user queries over multiple query images.

Our next goal is to make this system achieve high performance over moderately sized (TODO: dataset name) data sets.

Our final stretch goal is to scale this system to larger data sets, modifying it to be performant on these larger data sets.
