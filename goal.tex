\section{Resources}
We will be building our system on top of code taken from Lin et al.~\cite{gitrepo} from their CVPR 2015 workshop paper.
For hardware, we will be using the maas nodes owned by CMCL (maas.cmcl.cs.cmu.edu).
These machines are equipped with GTX 980 graphics cards, and there are 10 available for use.

We plan on using the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets when evaluating our system on moderately-sized datasets.
CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 images, which we believe is representative of a typical user's photograph collection.
When evaluating our system on large datasets, we hope to use a subset of Yahoo Webscope's 14.5tb image dataset.

\section{Evaluation Plan and Goals}

Our first goal is to create a system that returns qualitatively good content-based image retrieval based on user queries over multiple query images.
This will require modification of Lin et al.'s work on binary hash codes to enable multiple query images.
It is not entirely clear at the moment what this will entail, as the binary hash codes are built based on CNN activations as opposed to more
classic computer vision techniques.

Our next goal is to make this system achieve high performance over moderately sized (TODO: dataset name) data sets.
One important application we are interested in supporting is allowing users to execute content-based queries on their
own photo collections, so it is important that performance is well optimized for the user experience at this dataset size.

Our final stretch goal is to scale this system to larger data sets on the order of hundreds to thousands of gigabytes,
modifying it to be performant on these larger data sets.
To achieve this goal, we will run our system on a larger dataset and work to determine and alleviate performance bottlenecks.
